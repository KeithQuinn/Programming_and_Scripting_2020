## Weekly task 1 Problem:
No code required, direction was to introduce yourself in the discussion forum and download the required software - complete.

## Weekly task 2 Problem:
Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms. The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.

## Weekly task 4 Problem:
Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.

# Conclusion
These weekly tasks were brilliant, some of them took hours to figure out and after hours you end up with two lines of code! I felt the tasks were perfect, they were difficult enough that I could spend hours figuring them out but not too difficult as I was able to figure them out, eventually. The tasks emcompassed much of the python language, if, for, while, count, read, etc. so that was great.

What was also excellent was Andrew taking the time to review and provide feedback. I really enjoyed going back to the tasks armed with Andrew's feedback and also the knowledge gained throughout the semester and tidying up the code making it more readable and more efficient. I spent quiet a significant amount of time on these tasks but in the end I feel that the time was well spent as I have a decent understanding of the Python language.

The lab topics that Andrew went through were also a great addition to the course. For me the only way to learn this is to get stuck into it, so it was great having not only the weekly tasks to work on but also the labs. Now I'll take all these learnigns and apply them to the project to finish out the Programming and Scriping module, a module which I found challenging but thoroughly enjoyable, thanks.
